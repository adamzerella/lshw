# lshw - List hardware

> ðŸ’» Return the hardware configuration of the machine, inspired by [lshw](https://www.unix.com/man-page/linux/1/lshw/).

I'm aspiring to make open-source my full-time work. If you like the work that I do, please consider supporting me.

## Install
```bash
npm i -g lshw
```

## Usage

This project lacks many of the features from the original `lshw` tool. Additional issues arise when the [Node.js os](https://nodejs.org/api/os.html) library doesn't provide low-level support for things like PCI devices or motherboard bus information.

## CLI

```bash
$ lshw

# Usage: lshw [ options ] [ --version | --html | --json]
#                 lshw
# Options:
#         -V, --version           Output lshw version
#         -html, --html           Output hw configuration as HTML
#         -json, --json           Output hw configuration as JSON
```

### Yields:
```bash
